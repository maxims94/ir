# Intelligent Reader

* Can be used as a RSS Reader

## Accumulating information base

* Source: RSS feeds
* Database
    * SQLite?
* Format: Title | Abstract | Source | 
* In genera: (Info1 | Info2 | ... | InfoN) | Y/N

## Categorizing information

* Categorize information by supplying the Y/N information, i.e. is this particular information useful?
* In RSS Reader: Click on the item => Y; Skip it => N

## Infering information

* Which type of rules?
* How to represent in plaintext format?

* Example: 
    * Rule: Title.contains(politics) > Title.contains(economics)
    * Items will be sorted accordingly

## Unsupervised models combined with supervised

* Use case
    * The user creates a container named A
    * The user adds items X, Y and Z
    * The application discovers a pattern in X, Y, Z (e.g. Title.contains("geo"))
    * The application automatically adds the corresponding items to the categories

## Free parameters of the model

* The order in which information items are displayed
* The categories in which items are sorted
    * Accumulation of similar information items into containers
    * e.g. all football-related items from "Faz" and "Zeit" go to the container "Football"
